These are my codes for the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King

These are organized Chapterwise. The 'others' folder contains given examples from the book and also some of my own code.

Some files have the term "website" in their name. That means they contain code copied from the book's website.

I've been thorough in my practice through the book and hence you are going to find most of the Exercises and projects. Some may be missing or some may not be working because I am too lazy right now to upload the correct version of them that I wrote. But I think its the case with just 1 or 2 files.
