Ask the user to enter a series of brackets
read a left brace and push it in stack
when you encounter right brace
pop out stack
check if item popped out is a matching brace
if not then braces are not nested
When newline character is read check if stack is empty
if yes then braces are matched
if no and stack_underflow is ever called
braces are not matched
If stack overflow is called print "Stack overflow." and terminate immediately

FUNCTIONS THAT I CAN CREATE
read_brace:	reads braces till a newline character. For every
			brace read calls analyse function.

analyse:	reads the braces and when left brace occurs
			pushes it into the stack. If right one occurs
			then calls right_brace().

right_brace:	If right brace occurs pops the stack out.
				Checks if item is matching brace. If not
				prints output.de
